# OVERTURE

This is a relativley basic computer arcitecture that I learned how to build with a program called "Turing Complete." All components (including the ones labeled builtin) were designed by myself with assistance from community members of the Turing Complete Discord. Maze, mod_4, and spacial_invasion were instances where I had to use my own assembely to accomplish a task (although my approach to spacial_invasion was rudimentry).
